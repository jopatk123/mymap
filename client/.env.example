# client/.env.example
# Copy to client/.env for local development when needed.
# IMPORTANT:
# - Production builds should NOT hard-code backend container internal addresses.
# - Prefer using relative API paths (e.g. use `/api`), which are proxied by the server/nginx.
# - Only set VITE_API_BASE_URL for special local-debug scenarios.
# Example (local development only):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002
# Recommended production/default: leave empty so code falls back to relative '/api'.
